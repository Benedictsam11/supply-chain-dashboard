# Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This project is an Excel-based interactive dashboard built to analyse and visualise supply chain performance metrics.  
It was designed with a manufacturing and logistics focus, inspired by a real job description for a Graduate Supply Chain Data Analyst at Triumph Motorcycles.

The dashboard provides a clear, data-driven view of supplier performance, freight costs, monthly spend, and product demand - along with actionable insights.
